15th Preparation day
====================
Get the setup completed at the end of the day, and Ewoud blew the ESCs away !!! :)


16th of November - 1st day of the TU-Delft WindTunnel Campaign
==============================================================
Repaired the ESCs and get the system working again in the morning
Worked on the code in the begining of the afternoon

Around 4 o'clock we started the first full trials...


Missing things:
-Pressure sensor was not correctly tubed, reverse total and static pressure.
-Forgot to do no propeller tests
-


17th of November - 2nd day
==============================================================
Corrected the airspeed sensor, and orientation of the vehicle
1- Gravity Polar (17_11_17__09_09)
2- Half- 4m/s stopped it at the middle (no log)
Calibrated the control surface deflections
3- 4m/s full polar -5 to +75deg. (17_11_17__09_35)
4- 6m/s full polar -5 to +75deg. (17_11_17__10_01)
5- 8m/s full polar -5 to +75deg. (17_11_17__10_40)
6- Another gravity polar with 105.3g of weight attached to the top of the front connection line of the nose. (17_11_17__11_24)
7- 10m/s first trail, actuator is not strong enough to hold it... (17_11_17__11_46)
8- 10m/s 2nd trail of (-5 to +65deg), not successful (17_11_17__11_51)
--- Lunch Break ----
9- 10m/s with higher throttle values...
10- Trying again the below combination for 10m/s ... (13_17)
    Removed the +flap deflections and increased the throttle
    AoA_deg = np.arange(uf.get_hebi_from_aircraft_angle(-5), uf.get_hebi_from_aircraft_angle(+65), 0.17453)
    servo_valsr = [1500, 1700, 1833]
    servo_valsl = [1500, 1300, 1100]
    motor_vals  = [1500, 1600, 1700, 1800]
WORKED!
11- Static condition now with more throttle value... nope
12- Again static... nope!
13- One more static , damn forgot to change the throttle....
14- taped and changed the throttle so trhat it is not limitted 14_03
15... Several trials with static condition...
16 - Finally one static test : (17_11_17__14_11)

#########################
Took the propellers off !
17 - New gravity polar without the propellers. (17_11_17__14_21)

Starting the clean aircraft configuration tests
2 wrong starts...
18- 4m/s (17_11_17__14_29)
19- 6m/s (17_11_17__14_41)
20- 8m/s (14_51) Servo stopped working !!! we will repeating again.
21- 8m/s again, restarted. (14_57) The servo stopped again at around 62 degrees of AoA. The windtunnel is generating too much pressure on the control surface.
So much that it shuts-off.

22- 10m/s with less AoA forgot to plug the servos
23- 10m/s up to +35deg AoA (17_11_17__15_10)
24- 13m/s upto +35deg AoA (17_11_17__15_15)
25- 16m/s (17_11_17__15_22)
26- 20m/s trial DAMN! FAST! :) (17_11_17__15_31)

#########################
Propellers on again for higher speeds !

27- 13m/s : servos were not plugged (15_55)
28- 13m/s with motors on  (17_11_17__15_56)
AoA_deg = np.arange(uf.get_hebi_from_aircraft_angle(-5), uf.get_hebi_from_aircraft_angle(+35), 0.17453)
servo_valsr = [1500, 1700, 1833, 1300]
servo_valsl = [1500, 1300, 1100, 1700]
motor_vals  = [1400, 1500, 1600, 1700]
